In the course of this mid-course Summative Assessment project on data visualisation, I delved into the Superstore dataset using Tableau, addressing 30 scenario-based questions. 
Throughout my responses, I provided insights into chart findings, rationale for selecting specific chart types, and included visual evidence through screenshots of Tableau creations. 
These visualisations offer valuable insights, contributing to an enhanced understanding of Superstore performance and providing a foundation for strategic improvements.
